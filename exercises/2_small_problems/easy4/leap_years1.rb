# In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar,
# leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4,
# unless the year is also divisible by 100.

# If the year is evenly divisible by 100,
# then it is not a leap year
# unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

# Assume this rule is good for any year greater than year 0.
# Write a method that takes any year greater than 0 as input,
# and returns true if the year is a leap year,
# or false if it is not a leap year.
